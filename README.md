# cartography

## Goal
The goal of the project, as outlined in pasted-text.txt, is to create a Python program for generating maps with two primary modes:

* World Map Mode: Generate a full world map with a defined topography. All subsequent maps derived from this world map will adhere to its topographic structure, ensuring consistency. The program supports creating multiple distinct world maps.
* Simple Map Mode: Generate a specific, smaller part of a larger world map, focusing on a particular region while maintaining consistency with the parent world map's topography.
 
## To_DO
* Use a map image and and contrast land for black and water for white
* Develop logic to create similar contrasting maps
* Give texture and rules
